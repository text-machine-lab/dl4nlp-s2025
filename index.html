            <h4>Course description</h4>
            <p>

                In this course, we will study contemporary machine learning methods for understanding and generation of human language.  If you have taken
                machine learning and know how to implement, train, and deploy a classifier -- and now you want to understand how to bridge the gap between
                that and contemporary language models that can answer questions and hold a conversation, this course is for you.  Through a series of
                homeworks, you will learn how to implement and train neural models to process language, from word-level embeddings to Transformer
                language models, including implementation, pre-training, fine-tuning and other modes of deployment of such models for handling different
                aspects of processing human language.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Pre-requisite</b>: COMP 5500 / COMP 4600 Machine Learning or equivalent (with permission of instructor).
            </p>


            <h4>Class format</h4>

<p>Each class will be divided into</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lecture</li>
  <li>Practicum/Lab</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a 10-minute break after the lecture.</p>

<p>During the Practicum/Lab segment of the class, we will focus on technical (coding) skills and provide homework guidance.
You will be expected to work on your homework during this time, so please bring your laptop.</p>

<h4 id="homeworks">Homeworks</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We will have 6-7 homeworks.</li>
  <li>Homeworks are due at midnight on the day they are due.</li>
  <li>Homeworks will be posted on the course website and linked from the course schedule</li>
  <li>Homeworks must be submitted via Blackboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will discuss homework solutions in class the following week, and will ask you to self-grade
each homework after the solution is discussed</p>

<h4>Exams and Quizzes</h4>

<p>
Exams and quizzes will be closed book and will consist of (1) theoretical questions based the material discussed in class
and (2) question based on homework assignments. You may be asked to reproduce a part of your solution to homework questions and provide explanations.
</p>




<h4 id="research-paper-presentations">Research Paper Presentations</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Each student will be required to present a research paper assigned as readings for the class.</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="late-policy">Late Policy:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Homeworks will be accepted up to 2 (two) days after the original due date.</li>
  <li>Homeworks submitted up to 1 full day late will be graded at a 10% reduction.</li>
  <li>Homeworks submitted up to 2 full days late will be graded at a 20% reduction.</li>
  <li>After 2 days, Homeworks will not be accepted.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="collaboration-policy">Collaboration Policy:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Homeworks must be done individually.</li>
</ul>

<p>Violating the collaboration policy by copying other people's work, as well as any other instance of cheating,
including copying solutions from existing sources or submitting AI-generated code, carries the following penalties:
(1) First violation leads to getting zero credit for the submitted assignment (2) Second violation leads to failing
the course.</p>
